# AlexaDishwasher
An Alexa skill to keep track of the dishwasher's status. When living with multiple roommates you never really know if the dishes are clean or dirty. Fortunately, Alexa remembers for you.

To begin, say *"Alexa check the dishwasher"*.
She will either tell you this is the first time the skill has been accessed and therefore she needs to be told if the dishes are clean or dirty or she will tell you their current status.

To update the status of the dishes say *"The dishes are clean"* or *"The dishes are dirty"* or *"Clean"* or *"Dirty"* or *"They're clean*", etc.
